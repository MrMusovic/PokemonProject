HTML Page for the structure and icons
CSS page for the style behaviours. 
Currently we are using a flexbox for the nav bar with icon types. 

The main banner is named Hero Image, with various images in the hero image folder. 

Within the JS we are storing all of the clickable elements as variables, adding event listeners to them and finally executing a function when clicked. 
We would like to greatly simplify this code in order to increase responsiveness.
